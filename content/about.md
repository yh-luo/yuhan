Hi, I'm Yu-Han Luo. I'm currently pursuing a master degree of psychology in National Taiwan University in Taiwan.

## My research interests

+ How children acquire their first language? 
+ How cognitive abilities interact with language development? 
+ How to use pupillometry in developmental research?

## Aside from research

I'm interested in programming in R and Python, also trying to contribute to open-source programs/research.
In my free time, I enjoy reading, gaming, and watching videos about [animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drzq1x0mqjo), especially [cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rcvYfMFeE).

## Some not-so-boring facts about me:

+ Use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).
+ Bad at greeting.
+ Good at entertaining children.
