Hi, I'm Yu-Han Luo. I'm currently pursuing a master degree of psychology in National Taiwan University in Taiwan.
My research interests include:
+ How children acquire their first language? 
+ How cognitive abilities interact with language development? 
+ How to use pupillometry in developmental research?

Aside from research, I'm also interested in programming in R and Python. I'm also an enthusiast in open-source programs/research and trying to contribute.  
In my free time, I enjoy reading, gaming, and watching videos about [animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drzq1x0mqjo), especially [cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rcvYfMFeE).

Some not-so-boring facts about me:
+ Use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).
+ Bad at greeting.
+ Good at entertaining children.
