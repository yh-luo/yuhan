Hi, I'm Yu-Han Luo. I'm currently pursuing a master degree of psychology in National Taiwan University in Taiwan. My research interests include: How children acquire language? How cognitive abilities interact with language development? Aside from research, I'm also interested in programming in R and Python.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, gaming, and watching videos about [animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drzq1x0mqjo), especially [cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rcvYfMFeE). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZFEDELVYso) is some music that I recently dig in, have a great day!
